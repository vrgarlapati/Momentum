### FINE TUNE A GENERATIVE PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMER (GPT) MODEL AND CREATE AN INTERACTIVE HOW-TO-INSTRUCTION SYSTEM FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT

### Project Introduction
Users running into issues operating the Momentum software may reach out to customer service for support, which requires support personnel to expend valuable time on providing assistance and causes customers to have to wait for answers, even for issues with potentially simple solutions. If provided with an alternate means of handling these requests that doesnâ€™t require direct support by customer service, both support resources and customer time can be saved and applied to more critical tasks. The creation of a GPT-J based customer service model fine-tuned to the Momentum product manual can supply an additional line of support that does not require human intervention. Through the use of this model, customers will be able to get their questions answered quickly and precisely based directly on information taken from the product manual, ensuring they will only need to reach out to support for the most complex issues.
